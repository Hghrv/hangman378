# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

1. A description of the Hangman game project

        - What it does: The traditional Hangman game is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word while his opponent tries to guess that word within a limited amount of attempts. 

        - The aim of the project: Within the fields of Data Science, Data Architecture and software development, the management of data packages under Git environments comes across as a popular solution to guarrantee the efficiency of data handling for front-end and back-end users and developers.
        The aim of this project is to apply the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Advanced Python Programming to real a life scenario.
        In this case the project uses de OPP paradigm to propose an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer generates a word and the user tries to guess it.

        - Key points learned: The present project is developed under Git environment with Python.3. Different devolopers may collaborate via GitHub which provides a distributed control system.
        The local Git commands greatly minimise human errors and allow a more efficient developement of features as new branches may be implemented for each features.
        The use of fonctions and magic method prootes code reusability and highly reduces the likelihood of bugs.
        Reverting to a previous update is made possible by the .git file that traces all commits or versions.

2. Instructions

        Please note that Linux environment is used for development. On Mac, Git terminal is used for command line control (or Git bash for Windows)
        
        
        2a. Installation instructions

        The packages can be installed and unpacked by the following steps:

        - Step 1: Under Git environment, clone the Hangman repository with the command: Git clone url
        (Note: replace 'url' by the url link of this remote Hangman repository on GitHub).

        - Step 2: In your bash or python terminal, run milestone_5.py with the command: milestone_5.py

        You can also clone the repository to any supporting code editor such as VirtualStudioCode (with extensions) and run the milestone_5.py file from the local graphical unit interface.

        2b. Usage instructions

        After running the milestone_5.py file, the game should start.

        You will be requested to guess a word letter by letter. you have 5 attempts to guess the hidden word.

        Have fun !
