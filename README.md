# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

1. A description of the Hangman game project

        - What it does: 
        
        The traditional Hangman game is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word while his opponent tries to guess that word within a limited amount of attempts. 


        - The aim of the project: 
                
        Within the fields of Data Science, Data Architecture and Software Development, the management of data packages under Git environments comes across as a popular solution to guarrantee the efficiency of data handling for front-end and back-end users and developers.
        
        The aim of this project is to apply the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Advanced Python Programming to a real life scenario.
        
        In this case the project uses de OOP paradigm to propose an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer generates a word and the user tries to guess it.


        - Key points learned: 
        
        The present project is developed under Git environment with Python 3. Different devolopers may collaborate on a project via GitHub which provides a distributed version control system with pull requests capabilities.
        
        The local Git commands greatly minimise human errors and allow a more efficient developement of features as new branches may be implemented for each features on a local repository before being pushed remotely.
        
        The use of functions and magic methods greatly promotes code reusability and highly reduces repetition of code and the likelihood of bugs.
        
        Similarly, the extendabilities of branches allows to develop and debug various features separately while keeping the main repository accurate and updated after merging.
        
        Reverting to a previous update is made possible by the .git file that traces all commits or versions.

2. Instructions

        Please note that Linux environment is used for local development. On Mac, Git terminal is used for command line control (or Git bash for Windows)
        
        
        2a. Installation instructions

        The packages could be installed and unpacked in the following steps:

        - Step 1: Under Git environment, clone the Hangman repository with the command: Git clone url
        (Note: replace 'url' by the url link of this remote Hangman repository on GitHub).

        - Step 2: In your bash or python terminal, run milestone_5.py with the command: milestone_5.py

        You can also clone the repository to any supporting code editor such as VirtualStudioCode (with extensions) and run the milestone_5.py file from the local graphical unit interface.
        
        Please read the License Information section for copyrights policy and contact AICore directly if you would like to contribute with development ideas.

        2b. Usage instructions (Launch and play)

        After running the milestone_5.py file, the game should start.

        You will be requested to guess the name of a myterious fruit letter by letter. Your only clues are: the length of the hidden word, and the positions of your correct guessed letters. You only have 5 attempts to guess the hidden word.

        Enjoy the game and have fun !

        Please feel free to send notifications if you encounter any bug.
