1. A description of the Hangman game project

        - What it does: The traditional Hangman game is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word while his opponent tries to guess that word within a limited amount of attempts. 

        - The aim of the project: Within the fields of Data Science, Data Architecture and software development, the management of data packages under Git environments comes across as a popular solution to guarrantee the efficiency of data handling for front-end and back-end users and developers.
        The aim of this project is to apply the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Advanced Python Programming to real a life scenario.
        In this case the project uses de OPP paradigm to propose an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer generates a word and the user tries to guess it.

        - Key points learned: The present project is developed under Git environment with Python.3. Different devolopers may collaborate via GitHub which provides a distributed control system.
        The local Git commands greatly minimise human errors and allow a more efficient developement of features as new branches may be implemented for each features.
        The use of fonctions and magic method prootes code reusability and highly reduces the likelihood of bugs.
        Reverting to a previous update is made possible by the .git file that traces all commits or versions.
